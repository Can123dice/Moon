##The Night locker Project

ROLE: Project Initiator, Analyst, Front End Development, Branding

This is a project for storing the belongnings of homeless people in exchange for tokens they can collect at different places in the city on completion of certain tasks. e.g. collecting recyclables, having a shower, helping out in a comunity garden.  

I am doing initial fund rasing to do  pilot project and a proof of concept.Essentially 1 months rental, security and infrastructure for one month. If the pilot is successfull I plan to Shoot for the moon and try to buy a small warehouse to house the lockers, renting out space as well cheaply to help cover operational costs ...

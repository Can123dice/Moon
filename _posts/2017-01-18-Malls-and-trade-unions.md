## Malls and Trade Unions

Most of the people who work at your local mall use public transport. This is only anecdotal. (it would be interesting to see if there is any existing data on this) On the surface, this would seem surprising, there are no allowances made for commuters. 

It does not seem as if architects and the civil engineers  who design malls actually, take this into account, that workers who work at malls have to commute. It sometimes becomes a problem when people use natural walkways, or create them, if none are available. Paying customers who have their own transport are more important at every level and are sometimes being accommodated at the expense of workers who are reliant on public transport.  

In some cases malls are purposefully designed to discourage mini bus taxis access, because it temporarily obstructs drivers trying to get into a mall. This forces taxis to stop to deliver/pick up passengers in places that are not only inconvenient to their passengers, but create dangerous crossings. Crossings where pedestrians are willing to take their chances, and run across the road at the closest point to their taxi.

Designated areas for pedestrian crossing are not much better. A lot of these crossings are not designed in a way that makes it possible for people to cross safely. In a lot of cases, traffic flow is regulated in a way where you you have to literally run across to the other side to make it in time, before you get driven over.  

The speed limit for vehicles is set at 60 km on popular crossings irrespective of foot traffic volumes on intersections of popular municipal roads close to certain shopping malls. There is no way a car, let alone a truck or bus will be able to stop in time even if the crossing is clearly signposted. Pedestrians have to take a gap in the traffic because most drivers do not give them the opportunity to cross safely.

Necessary jaywalking is exacerbated by narrow or non existent walkways, especially at entrances to malls and buildings with a boom or two. It is dangerous. Pedestrians can be hit by cars, and cars can have accidents, trying to avoid pedestrians swerving into an on-ramp because of an obstructed walkway into a parking arcade for example.  

Those same pedestrian crossings are also not well lit at night. Walkways at night is a major issue. Certain access roads are closed at night due to security concerns from malls, for both patrons safety and that of businesses. Workers who end their shifts late are then forced to go around their normal path and use walkways which usually unlit and pass past derelict areas where criminals know they can get away with robbing people on their way from work.

I think trade unions should be advocating for all workers in the retail sector, by asking malls to become more commuter friendly by:
Requesting Lighted evening walkways.
Requesting better security along those routes
Make sure malls provide proper pedestrian walkways to and from the mall from public transport hubs.

They should also lobby at town planning at Local Municipal Level to:
Do a commuter route audit, to improve walkway planning. 
Change local bylaws, so public commuter access becomes a prerequisite to commercial property approval. 

This will benefit everyone. Not only will this mean big efficiency gains by cutting down on commuting time and congestion for pedestrians and drivers, but shop owners. Workers will be more on time, more awake and less stressed.

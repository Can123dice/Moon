##Consumer Rights Web App

ROLE: Interface Design\UX,Web Design

Ths is a consumer mobile web app, to help you deal with situations in which you need to know your rights as a consumer. The app alows you to search for the situation you are in, then you can access resources relevant to the situation. It alows you either to be forwarded to where you can get help with your specific complaint or use the email facility to contact the company directly.

What I did here, was working with someone to build the data structure and the data flow. 
Already resarch on consumer behavoir and other channels already available. Portal unifying how they send their complaints. So you can be redirected to the correct ombutsman. And so you can know your rights on the spot and what to do in different situations. 

First defining the most relevant personas, and deciding on scope. Where it would have the most impact. Then what is available, and what text can be used that is free to use without incuring aditional royalties. From there what is posible, using what type of tecnology. ... and who can access it, especially in the south african context... Older smarphones and legacy devices. A fair amount of blackberry's and devices.

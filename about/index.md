### About Candice

I am Candice and I am a pathological optimist. My main focus at the moment is on finding viable solutions to problems working and middle class people face every day. I do this by taking on small side projects which address structural and spatial inequality, to make South Africa more equitable, and South Africans happier and more efficient.

### More Information

I am also an indie game designer. I am interested in collaborating with graphic artists, composers, develpers. If you want to collaborate with me, please send me an email.

### About this website

This website was generated by Jekyll(a blog-aware, static site generator). Github acts as its CMS and I used <a href="http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon"><b>Moon</b></a>  a minimal, one column jekyll theme as the basis for the current design.

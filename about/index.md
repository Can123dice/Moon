##About Candice

Candice is a, nah I can't get the hang of writing about myself in the third person, so here goes...

I am Candice and I am a pathalogical optimist when it comes to my current bigest interest, Free and Open Software.

In the past I have worked with VB, and I have had pleasant run-ins with both C and C++ but for some reason I detest Java with passionate intensity. At the moment I quite enjoy working with my all time favourite language tool ,Python. We have our moments, but it allows me to let my imagination fly without having to stumble over details of a single.missed.bracket.

### More Information

 I enjoy creating music, but suck at the art of performance.

### About this website

This website was generated by Jekyll(a blog-aware, static site generator). Github acts as its CMS and I used <a href="http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon"><b>Moon</b></a>  a minimal, one column jekyll theme as the basis for the current design.
